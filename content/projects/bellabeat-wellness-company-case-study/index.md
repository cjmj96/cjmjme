## Summary

### Goal

The objective of this project is to use the data analytics life cycle to solve the business task of CBellabeat, a woman wellness company. I use the Fitbit fitness tracker data to support my case. My insights will help to design a marketing campaign to unlock new grow opportunities for the company.


### Process

I begin the data analytic process by obtaining the questions that will drive my analysis. Once I have identified these questions, I retrieve the necessary data from Divvy and merge them into a single feather-formatted file. Before proceeding with the analysis, I verify the data integrity and clean data where necessary. On the analysis phase, I perform data transformation to extract meaningful insights. Once I have identified the key findings, I share my conclusions. Finally, I present my recommendations to drive decision-making.



### Highlights

This project is carried out using Python, using data-science related libraries given its capabilities to handle medium to large sized datasets.

Fitbit users tend to support a sedentary lifestyle consistently across different periods. Other health related measures support the previous result. This suggest a preliminary trend that could poten
 lead to long-term negative effects on their health and overall well-being.
