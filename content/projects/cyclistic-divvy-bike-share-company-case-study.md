## Summary

### Goal

The objective of this project is to use the data analytics life cycle to solve the business task of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. I use the Divvy historical trip data to support my case. My insights will help to design a marketing campaign that aims to encourage casual users (single or day pass) to become annual subscribers.


### Process

I begin the data analytic process by obtaining the questions that will drive my analysis. Once I have identified these questions, I retrieve the necessary data from Divvy and merge them into a single feather-formatted file. Before proceeding with the analysis, I verify the data integrity and clean data where necessary. On the analysis phase, I perform data transformation to extract meaningful insights. Once I have identified the key findings, I share my conclusions. Finally, I present my recommendations to drive decision-making.



### Highlights

This project is carried out using R, using data-science related packages given its capabilities to handle medium to large sized datasets.

Casual and member users show clear patterns in different travel-related metrics. Casual users tend to travel farther than member users regardless of time periods. The same happens when comparing trip length. This pattern changes in bike rides performed where member users performed most of them regardless of time periods.
