## Summary

### Goal

The objective of this project is to use the data analytics life cycle to solve the business task of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-sharing company. I use the Divvy historical trip data to support my case. My insights will help to design a marketing campaign that aims to encourage casual users (single or day pass) to become annual subscribers.


### Process

I begin the data analytic process by obtaining the questions that should drive my analysis. After that, I obtained the data from Divvy, merged the files into a single file with feather format. The data processing involved verifying the data integrity and cleaning data where necessary. In the analysis phase, I perform data transformation. After that, I share the insights and conclusions for my analysis. And finally, I proposed my recommendations to drive decision making.
